                target="_blank" title="JavaScript specification">JavaScript</a>, often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language that conforms to the ECMAScript specification.
                JavaScript is high-level, often just-in-time compiled, and multi-paradigm.
                It has curly-bracket syntax, dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions.
                
                Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web.
                Over 97% of websites use it client-side for web page behavior,often incorporating third-party libraries.
                All major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute the code on the user's device.
